      # The activator (often) sits on the dataplane, and may proxy long (e.g.
      # streaming, websockets) requests.  We give a long grace period for the
      # activator to "lame duck" and drain outstanding requests before we
      # forcibly terminate the pod (and outstanding connections).  This value
